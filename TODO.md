# Todo:

- make direction and repeat GTLD_Container property, maybe rename it along the way
- screw memory efficiency for now, memory safety first: make everything unique
- add tree traversal functions
- create an id to SDL_Texture map and interface for that
- have a beer or two

# Just overall ideas
- Pass everything bigger than 8 bytes by reference
